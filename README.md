# Wealth of Nations — Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project explores how economic prosperity relates to population well-being using data from the **World Bank Open Data API**.

We analyze the relationships between:
- GDP per capita (current US$)
- Life expectancy at birth
- Health spending per capita
- Under-5 child mortality

The goal is to reveal trends and correlations that explain how nations thrive.
